Orange is a statically typed, multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented) systems programming language with a focus on high productivity and extendability.

# Goals

- _Be Productive_. Provide a simple syntax for writing code quickly and make it easy to download and install project dependencies. Provide strict type checking to make sure basic type errors can’t happen.
- _Be Extendible_. Allow developers to extend new interfaces to existing types, and allow creating/using compiler extensions that can add new language features or code checks.
- _Be Flexible_. Combine the extendability and productivity to make Orange suitable for any kind of development, from embedded programming to high-level applications like web servers.
