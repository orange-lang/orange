Orange is a statically typed, multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented) systems programming language with a focus on high productivity and extendability.

# Goals

- _Be Productive_. Provide a simple syntax for writing code quickly and make it easy to download and install project dependencies. Provide strict type checking to make sure basic type errors canâ€™t happen.
- _Be Extendible_. Allow developers to extend new interfaces to existing types, and allow for creating/downloading compiler extensions that can add new language features and code checks.
- _Be Flexible_. Combine the extendibility and productivity to make Orange suitable for any kind of development, from embedded programming to high-level applications like web servers.

# Note

The language has been redesigned since 2014 and the code is being re-written from scratch. See [here](https://github.com/orange-lang/orange/tree/inactive/rev-0) for the old code.

People who pulled `master` before January 2017 may have to do a force reset to the new master branch.
